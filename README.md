# HOLOBRAIN

* Interactive 3D MRI Analysis with a Gesture-Controlled Hologram
* Bringing Medical Imaging to Life: Diagnose, Detect, and Visualize

## Insperation

Our friends working in radiology had a common problemâ€”the inefficiency of diagnosing MRI scans by eye. The human brain's complexity and how MRSs are displayed posed a difficult challenge for radiologists, as they had to go through multiple slices of the brain, diagnosing each to sort healthy ones from possible problematic ones. We realized we had an exciting skill set that could be combined to create a solution, with knowledge of Python and Unity, to help better those in the medical field and leverage the power of AI in making their work more efficient.

## Description

HoloBrain does two things. First, there is a CNN model that can distinguish healthy brains from diseased or problematic ones. From there, you can take the diseased brain, upload it as an asset, and view it through the Dynamic HUD. In doing so, doctors can better visualize, locate, and hopefully treat any brain abnormality before it gets too late much more effectively. This HUD also uses gesture control, meaning that by using your hands in front of a camera, doctors and students can move and zoom around the brain, better showing each part, entirely controlled by the user for what they want.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.12.7+
* Unity + C#
